# CS-509-WordSweeper-Pisces

WordSweeper is a multi-player word puzzle game in which players can create or join games hosted on a server to compete with other players, by selecting letters from a board that form words to gain points. The game also implements a local practice mode for the player to get familiar with the rules. As a team focus on the client side, we went through the full development process of use cases definition, UML modeling, storyboarding, coding in collaboration with a server team, and testing to ensure correct all end-to-end gameplay scenarios.
